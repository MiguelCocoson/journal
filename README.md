# Overview

I created this database and website because I think the traditional way of writing a journal on paper is not very efficiant anymore. Thorugh this website people can keep a journal without fear of loosing their journal and been able to make corrections to their entries very easy.

# Cloud Database

The Google Cloud Firestore Database is a very simple cloud database provider that let's you store data. This provider is a simple and very useful way to get introduce to the world of cloud database.

This database allow programers to create, edit and erase data. It creates a collection of data and through coding lenguages like Javascript, a website, app, and other programs can be use as a user friendly source to access their data.

# Development Environment

I used the Google Cloud Firestore to create the database for the website.
